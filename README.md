Project management:

This project is designed to streamline the management of simple projects by providing tools for managing products and calculating their costs. Users can input product details such as price, advertising costs, applicable taxes, and any available discounts. The total price is then calculated based on these inputs and added to the existing stock. Additionally, the product is categorized according to its relevant category.

Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are used to manage the data, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are utilized to develop the user interface and interactivity.
